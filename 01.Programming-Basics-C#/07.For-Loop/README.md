# For Loop – Programming Basics with C# 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **For Loop** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

# 🔧 Summary of Programming Exercises

### 📝 Exercise 1: [Print Numbers 1 through 100]  
**Description:**  
Develop a simple application that outputs every number starting at 1 and ending at 100, printing each number on a separate line.

---

### 📝 Exercise 2: [Countdown from N to 1]  
**Description:**  
Create a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer `n` (always greater than 1). The program should then display all numbers starting from `n` counting down to 1, each printed on its own line.

---

### 📝 Exercise 3: [Numbers from 1 to N with Step Size 3]  
**Description:**  
Write code that takes an integer `n` as input and prints all numbers beginning at 1 up to `n`, incrementing by 3 each time.

---

### 📝 Exercise 4: [Print Even Exponents of 2]  
**Description:**  
Implement a program that accepts an integer `n` and prints the powers of two raised to even exponents (0, 2, 4, ...) up to `n`. For example, 2⁰, 2², 2⁴, ..., until the exponent reaches `n`.

---

### 📝 Exercise 5: [Output Characters Individually]  
**Description:**  
Build a program that reads a line of text from the user and prints each character on a new line, effectively breaking the string into individual characters.

---

### 📝 Exercise 6: [Calculate Vowel Sum]  
**Description:**  
Write a program that takes a user-input string and calculates the total value of all vowels found within it. Each vowel has a specific assigned value:

| Vowel | a | e | i | o | u |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

The program should sum these values and print the result.

---

### 📝 Exercise 7: [Sum of Multiple Integers]  
**Description:**  
Create a program that first reads a number `n`, indicating how many integers will follow. Then, read those `n` integers one by one, calculate their sum, and output the total.

---

### 📝 Exercise 8: [Find Minimum and Maximum]  
**Description:**  
Develop a solution that reads `n` integers and identifies the smallest and largest number among them. Print both values.

---

### 📝 Exercise 9: [Compare Left and Right Halves]  
**Description:**  
Write a program that accepts `2 * n` integers. Sum the first `n` numbers (left side) and the following `n` numbers (right side). If the sums match, print a confirmation with the sum value. Otherwise, print the absolute difference between the sums.

---

### 📝 Exercise 10: [Sum by Even and Odd Positions]  
**Description:**  
Implement a program that reads `n` integers and calculates two sums: one of the numbers at even positions and another of those at odd positions (considering the first number as position 1). If the sums are equal, print "Yes" followed by the sum value. If not, print "No" and the absolute difference between the sums.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
