# For Loop – Programming Basics with C# 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **For Loop** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: [Numbers from 1 to 100]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each on a new line.

---

### 📝 Task 2: [Numbers from N to 1 in Reverse Order]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads a positive integer `n` entered by the user and prints the numbers from `n` to 1 in reverse order. The entered number `n` will always be greater than 1.

---

### 📝 Task 3: [Numbers from 1 to N with Step 3]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads an integer `n` entered by the user and prints the numbers from 1 to `n` with a step of 3.

---

### 📝 Task 4: [Even Powers of 2]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads an integer `n` entered by the user and prints the even powers of 2 (2^0, 2^2, 2^4, …, up to 2^n).

---

### 📝 Task 5: [Stream of Characters]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads a string entered by the user and prints each character from the string on a new line.

---

### 📝 Task 6: [Summing the Vowels]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads a string entered by the user and calculates and prints the sum of the values of the vowels according to the table below:

| Letter | a | e | i | o | u |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

---

### 📝 Task 7: [Summing the Numbers]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads `n` integers entered by the user and sums them.

- The first line of input contains the number `n`.
- The next `n` lines contain one integer each.

The program should read the numbers, sum them, and print the result.

---

### 📝 Task 8: [Sequence of Integers]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads `n` integers. Print the largest and smallest number among the entered numbers.

---

### 📝 Task 9: [Left and Right Sum]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads `2 * n` integers entered by the user and checks if the sum of the first `n` numbers (left sum) is equal to the sum of the next `n` numbers (right sum). If they are equal, print "Yes, sum = [sum]"; otherwise, print "No, diff = [difference]". The difference should be calculated as an absolute value.

---

### 📝 Task 10: [Even / Odd Sum]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads `n` integers entered by the user and checks if the sum of the numbers at even positions is equal to the sum of the numbers at odd positions.

- If the sums are equal, print two lines: "Yes" and on the next line "Sum = [sum]".
- If the sums are not equal, print two lines: "No" and on the next line "Diff = [difference]".  
The difference should be calculated as an absolute value.
