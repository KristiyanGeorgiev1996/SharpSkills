# Conditional Statements – Programming Basics with C# 🧑‍💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Conditional Statements** section of the _Programming Basics with C#_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: [Excellent Grade]  
**Problem Statement:**  
The first task in this section is to write a console program that reads a grade (a floating-point number) entered by the user and prints "Excellent!" if the grade is 5.50 or higher.

### 📝 Task 2: [Greater Number]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads two integers entered by the user and prints the greater of the two.

---

### 📝 Task 3: [Even or Odd]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and prints whether it is even or odd.

- If it is even, print "even".
- If it is odd, print "odd".

---

### 📝 Task 4: [Guess the Password]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads a password (text) entered by the user and checks if it matches the phrase "s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd".  

- If it matches, print "Welcome".  
- If it doesn’t match, print "Wrong password!".

### 📝 Task 5: [Number Between 100 and 200]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and checks whether it is below 100, between 100 and 200, or above 200.

- If the number is less than 100, print: "Less than 100"  
- If the number is between 100 and 200, print: "Between 100 and 200"  
- If the number is greater than 200, print: "Greater than 200"

### 📝 Task 6: [Speed Info]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that reads a speed (real number) entered by the user and prints information about the speed:

- Up to 10 (inclusive): print "slow"  
- Over 10 and up to 50 (inclusive): print "average"  
- Over 50 and up to 150 (inclusive): print "fast"  
- Over 150 and up to 1000 (inclusive): print "ultra fast"  
- Above 1000: print "extremely fast"

---

### 📝 Task 7: [Area of Figures]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that lets the user enter the type and dimensions of a geometric figure, and calculates its area. There are four types of figures: square, rectangle, circle, and triangle.

- If the figure is a square: on the next line, read one floating-point number – the length of its side.  
- If the figure is a rectangle: on the next two lines, read two floating-point numbers – the lengths of its sides.  
- If the figure is a circle: on the next line, read one floating-point number – the radius of the circle.  
- If the figure is a triangle: on the next two lines, read two floating-point numbers – the length of the side and the height to it.

The result should be rounded to 3 decimal places.
