# Programming Basics with C#

The Programming Basics with C# course introduces the essential programming concepts required for various technology fields. Students learn to write simple code, work efficiently with development environments, and understand fundamental programming constructs. The course covers variables, data types, operators, expressions, console input/output, conditional statements (if, if-else), and loops (for, while).

This course culminates with a practical programming exam that serves as an entrance requirement for the Software Engineering program.

The "Programming Basics" course concludes with a practical programming exam, which serves as an entrance requirement for the Software Engineering program at SoftUni.

## Skills Acquired:
- Reading input and printing output via the console
- Using loops to repeat actions (for, while)
- Applying conditional logic with if and if-else statements
- Combining nested conditional checks for decision-making
- Performing basic calculations and data manipulations
- Writing nested loops to handle more complex iterative tasks
