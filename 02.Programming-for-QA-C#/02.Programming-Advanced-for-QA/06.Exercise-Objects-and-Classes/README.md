- `ChangeAuthor(newAuthor)` ‚Äì modifies the author name  
- `Rename(newTitle)` ‚Äì updates the title

  `{title} - {content}: {author}`  

**Input:**  
- The first input line contains the initial article info in the format:  
  `{title}, {content}, {author}`  
- Next, read an integer `n` for the number of commands to follow.  
- The next `n` lines are commands in one of these formats:

### üìù Task 3: Teamwork Projects Management

**Description:**  
Create a system to register teams and assign users to them.

**Input:**  
- First, read the number of teams to create.  
- For each team, input the creation line in the format:  
  `{creator}-{teamName}`  
  Upon successful creation, print:  
  `Team {teamName} has been created by {creator}!`  

- Then read member assignments in the format:  
  `{user}-> {teamName}`  
- Stop reading when you receive `"end of assignment"`.

**Constraints & Validation:**  
- If the team name is already taken, print:  
  `Team {teamName} was already created!`  
- If a creator attempts to create more than one team, print:  
  `{user} cannot create another team!`  
- If a user tries to join a non-existent team, print:  
  `Team {teamName} does not exist!`  
- If a user is already in any team, print:  
  `Member {user} cannot join team {teamName}!`  

**Output:**  
- Print teams with members sorted by member count (descending), then by team name (ascending).  
- For each team print:  
  `{teamName}`  
  `{creator} -- {member1} -- {member2} ...`  

- Finally, print teams without members (only creator) sorted alphabetically:  
  `Teams to disband: {teamName1} {teamName2} ...`
