# Programming Advanced for QA

This course builds upon fundamental programming knowledge and introduces more advanced concepts relevant to quality assurance and automation. Students will work with associative data structures and gain experience in string manipulation, including the use of regular expressions. The course covers in-depth object-oriented programming principles such as defining classes and objects, implementing inheritance, and working with interfaces. Additionally, learners will explore advanced features like static members, generics, and exception handling.

The practical part of the course involves a comprehensive project where students design, implement, and test an object-oriented application. This project helps solidify their understanding of software design patterns, coding best practices, and test automation methodologies through hands-on exercises and real-world examples.

## Skills you will develop

- Using associative collections and data structures  
- Manipulating strings and applying regular expressions  
- Defining and working with classes and generic types  
- Building class hierarchies and employing inheritance  
- Applying object-oriented programming concepts in practice
