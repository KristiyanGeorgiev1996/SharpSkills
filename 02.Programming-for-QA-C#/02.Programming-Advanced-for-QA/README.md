# Programming Advanced for QA

The course delves deeper into programming concepts, associative arrays, lambda expressions, LINQ, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming, including classes and objects, inheritance, and interfaces. In this course, learners will define and use classes and objects, and will also explore advanced topics such as static members, generic types, and exceptions. The course concludes with a practical project, where students will implement an OOP project, navigate through it, and test it, applying popular methodologies and best practices for writing code. Throughout the course, learners will gain hands-on experience through exercises that will help them master key concepts.
