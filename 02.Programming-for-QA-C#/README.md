# Programming for QA

The module aims to provide students with programming skills necessary for the software quality assurance process, focusing on the .NET platform and the C# language in various aspects. It covers the fundamentals of programming, testing, data structures, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Learners will gain knowledge of automated testing principles, explore different automation frameworks, and write tests using NUnit. The module includes plenty of practical exercises and projects to ensure that participants are prepared to apply their knowledge in a real business context.

The module includes two sub-courses:
- **Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing** – covers the basics of programming in C# and introduces component/unit testing using the NUnit framework.
- **Programming Advanced for QA** – builds upon the fundamentals by introducing more complex data structures, generic programming, regular expressions, and more advanced OOP concepts relevant to test automation.
