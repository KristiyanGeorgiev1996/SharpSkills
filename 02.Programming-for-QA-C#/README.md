# Programming for QA

This module is designed to equip students with essential programming skills tailored for software quality assurance roles, with a focus on the .NET environment and C# language. It covers core programming principles, introduces testing concepts, and dives into key data structures and object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. Throughout the course, learners will explore automated testing frameworks, especially NUnit, and develop hands-on experience by writing and running unit tests. The curriculum emphasizes practical exercises and real-world projects to prepare participants for effective application of their skills in professional testing environments.

The module is divided into two parts:  
- **Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing** – introduces the basics of C# programming alongside fundamental unit testing practices using NUnit.  
- **Advanced Programming for QA** – extends foundational knowledge by exploring more sophisticated data structures, generics, regular expressions, and advanced OOP concepts important for test automation development.

## Key Competencies You Will Develop...
