# Simple Conditional Statements â€“ Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing ðŸ§‘ðŸ’»

This folder contains tasks from the **Simple Conditional Statements** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Freezing Weather Check

Create a program that:

- Reads an integer representing temperature in Celsius  
- Determines if the temperature is at or below zero  
- Prints `"Freezing weather!"` if the temperature meets the condition

---

### Task 2: Even or Odd Number

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number  
- Prints `"even"` if the number is even  
- Prints `"odd"` if the number is odd

---

### Task 3: Number to Word (1 to 9)

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number  
- If the number is between 1 and 9 inclusive, prints the corresponding English word:  
  - 1 â†’ `"one"`  
  - 2 â†’ `"two"`  
  - 3 â†’ `"three"`  
  - 4 â†’ `"four"`  
  - 5 â†’ `"five"`  
  - 6 â†’ `"six"`  
  - 7 â†’ `"seven"`  
  - 8 â†’ `"eight"`  
  - 9 â†’ `"nine"`  
- Prints `"Out of range"` if the number is outside this range

---

### Task 4: Find the Greater Number

Write a program that:

- Reads two integer numbers  
- Compares them to find the greater number  
- Prints the result in the format:  
  `"Greater number: {value}"`

---

### Task 5: Password Validation

Write a program that:

- Reads a string input (password)  
- Prints `"Welcome"` if the input matches `"s3cr3t!"` exactly  
- Prints `"Wrong password!"` otherwise

---

### Task 6: Boiling Water Check

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer temperature in Celsius  
- Prints `"The water is boiling"` if the temperature is greater than 100  
- Otherwise, prints `"The water is not hot enough"`

---

### Task 7: Speed Classification

Write a program that:

- Reads a floating-point number representing speed  
- Prints `"Slow"` if speed is less than or equal to 30  
- Prints `"Fast"` if speed is greater than 30

---

### Task 8: Ticket Price Calculator

Write a program that:

- Reads a string indicating the ticket type (`"student"` or `"regular"`)  
- Prints the ticket price according to the type:  
  - Student ticket: `$1.00`  
  - Regular ticket: `$1.60`  
- Prints `"Invalid ticket type!"` for any other input

---

### Task 9: Triangle Validity Check

Write a program that:

- Reads three integers representing the sides of a triangle  
- Checks if the triangle is valid by ensuring each side is less than the sum of the other two sides  
- Prints `"Valid Triangle"` if the triangle satisfies this condition  
- Prints `"Invalid Triangle"` otherwise

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
