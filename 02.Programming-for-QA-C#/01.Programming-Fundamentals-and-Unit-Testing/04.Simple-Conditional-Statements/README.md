  - `"seven"` if the number is 7  
  - `"eight"` if the number is 8  
  - `"nine"` if the number is 9  
  - `"Out of range"` if the number is outside this range

---

### 📝 Task 4: Greater Number
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads two integer numbers  
- Finds the greater number  
- Prints: `"Greater number: {greater number value}"`

---

### 📝 Task 5: Guess the Password
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to check a password:

- Reads a string input  
- Prints:
  - `"Welcome"` if the password is `"s3cr3t!"`  
  - `"Wrong password!"` otherwise

---

### 📝 Task 6: Boiling Water
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to check if water is boiling:

- Reads an integer number (temperature in °C)  
- Prints:
  - `"The water is boiling"` if the number is greater than 100  
  - `"The water is not hot enough"` otherwise

---

### 📝 Task 7: Speed Info
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads a floating-point number (speed)  
- Prints:
  - `"Slow"` if the speed is less than or equal to 30  
  - `"Fast"` if the speed is greater than 30

---

### 📝 Task 8: Ticket Price
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to calculate ticket price:

- Reads a ticket type (string): `"student"` or `"regular"`  
- Prints the price:
  - `"${1.00}"` for student  
  - `"${1.60}"` for regular  
  - `"Invalid ticket type!"` for all other input

---

### 📝 Task 9: Valid Triangle
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to check if a triangle is valid:

- Reads three integers: the sides of a triangle  
- Checks whether each side is shorter than the sum of the other two  
- Prints:
  - `"Valid Triangle"` if the condition is satisfied  
  - `"Invalid Triangle"` otherwise
