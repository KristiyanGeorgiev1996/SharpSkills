# Exercise - Methods – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Exercise - Methods** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Vowels Count  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a text (string) from the console  
- Implements a method that receives the text and returns the count of vowels in it  
- Prints the count of vowels found in the text

---

### 📝 Task 2: Factorial Division  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two integers in the range [1…10] from the console  
- Calculates the factorial of each number  
- Divides the first factorial by the second factorial (integer division)  
- Prints the result of the division

---

### 📝 Task 3: Multiplication Sign  
Write a program that:  
- Reads three integers (num1, num2, num3) from the console  
- Determines whether the product num1 * num2 * num3 is negative, positive or zero  
- Prints:  
  - "negative" if the product < 0  
  - "positive" if the product > 0  
  - "zero" if the product = 0  

*Note: Do this without actually multiplying the three numbers.*

### 📝 Task 4: Password Validator  
Write a program that validates a password with the following rules:  
- Password length must be between 6 and 10 characters (inclusive)  
- Password must consist only of letters and digits  
- Password must contain at least 2 digits  

For every rule not fulfilled, print the corresponding message:  
- "Password must be between 6 and 10 characters"  
- "Password must consist only of letters and digits"  
- "Password must have at least 2 digits"

### 📝 Task 5: Multiply Evens by Odds  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number from the console  
- Implements:  
  - `GetSumOfEvenDigits()` - returns the sum of even digits in the number  
  - `GetSumOfOddDigits()` - returns the sum of odd digits in the number  
  - `GetMultipleOfEvenAndOdds()` - returns the multiplication of the sums above  
- Use `Math.Abs()` for negative numbers if needed

---

### 📝 Task 6: Orders  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a product name (string): "coffee", "water", "coke", or "snacks"  
- Reads a quantity (integer)  
- Implements a method that calculates and prints the total price for the order  
- Prices per item:  
  - coffee – 1.50  
  - water – 1.00  
  - coke – 1.40  
  - snacks – 2.00  
- Prints the total price formatted to 2 decimal places
