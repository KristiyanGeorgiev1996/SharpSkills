# Exercise - Arrays – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Exercise - Arrays** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: [Equal Arrays]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Read two arrays with the same length from the console
- Check whether they are identical or not
  - If the arrays are identical, print: "Arrays are identical."
  - If the arrays are NOT identical, print: "Arrays are not identical."

Note: Arrays are identical if their elements are equal.

### 📝 Task 2: [Common Elements]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Read two integer arrays with the same length from the console
- Prints common elements in two arrays, space-separated

---

### 📝 Task 3: [Condense Array to Number]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Read a sequence of integer numbers from the console
- Condense them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single integer is obtained

Example: If we have 3 elements {2, 10, 3}. We sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13}. Then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.

### 📝 Task 4: [Magic Sum]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Read a sequence of integer numbers from the first line of the console
- Read an integer number (control number) from the second line of the console
- Print all unique pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to a control number

---

### 📝 Task 5: [Zig-Zag Arrays]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Creates two empty integer arrays
- Reads an integer number N from the console
- Reads two integer numbers on the next N lines
- Form two integer arrays as shown below

---

### 📝 Task 6: [Array Rotation]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads sequence of integer numbers from the first line of the console
- Reads an integer number (rotations you have to perform) from the second line of the console
- Each rotation is when the first element goes at the end
- Print the resulting sequence

---

### 📝 Task 7: [Top Integers]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads sequence of integer numbers from the first line of the console
- Find all the top integers in a sequence
- A top integer is an integer that is bigger than all the elements to its right
