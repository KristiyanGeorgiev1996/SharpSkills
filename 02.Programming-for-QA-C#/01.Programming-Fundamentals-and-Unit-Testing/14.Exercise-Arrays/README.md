# Exercise - Arrays â€“ Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing ðŸ§‘ðŸ’»

This folder contains tasks from the **Exercise - Arrays** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks Overview:

---

### Task 1: Equal Arrays  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two arrays of equal length from the console  
- Checks if the arrays are identical (element by element)  
- Prints:  
  - "Arrays are identical." if they are the same  
  - "Arrays are not identical." otherwise

---

### Task 2: Common Elements  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two integer arrays of equal length from the console  
- Prints the common elements between the two arrays, separated by spaces

---

### Task 3: Condense Array to Number  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a sequence of integer numbers from the console  
- Condenses the array by repeatedly summing adjacent pairs until only one number remains  
- Prints the final single integer

Example:  
Input: `{2, 10, 3}`  
Condense step 1: `{2+10, 10+3}` â†’ `{12, 13}`  
Condense step 2: `{12+13}` â†’ `{25}`

---

### Task 4: Magic Sum  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a sequence of integers from the first input line  
- Reads an integer control number from the second input line  
- Prints all unique pairs from the array whose sum equals the control number

---

### Task 5: Zig-Zag Arrays  
Write a program that:  
- Creates two empty integer arrays  
- Reads an integer N  
- Reads N lines with two integers each  
- Fills the two arrays in a zig-zag pattern based on the input numbers

---

### Task 6: Array Rotation  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a sequence of integers from the first line  
- Reads an integer number indicating how many rotations to perform  
- Performs rotations by moving the first element to the end, repeated for the given number  
- Prints the resulting sequence after rotations

---

### Task 7: Top Integers  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a sequence of integers from the first line  
- Finds and prints all "top integers" â€” elements that are greater than all elements to their right in the sequence

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
