# Methods – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Methods** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Sign of Integer Number  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number N from input.  
- Implements a method that prints the sign of N:  
  - If N > 0: prints `"The number {N} is positive."`  
  - If N < 0: prints `"The number {N} is negative."`  
  - If N = 0: prints `"The number {N} is zero."`

### 📝 Task 2: Grades  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a floating-point grade from input.  
- Implements a method that receives a grade between 2.00 and 6.00 and prints the grade in words:  
  - "Fail" for grades 2.00 – 2.99  
  - "Average" for grades 3.00 – 3.49  
  - "Good" for grades 3.50 – 4.49  
  - "Very good" for grades 4.50 – 5.49  
  - "Excellent" for grades 5.50 – 6.00

### 📝 Task 3: Printing Triangle  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer N from input.  
- Implements a method to print a triangle based on N.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Calculate Rectangle Area  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two integers: width and length.  
- Implements a method that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle (width × length).

---

### 📝 Task 5: Repeat String  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a string and a repeat count (integer) from input.  
- Implements a method that receives the string and repeat count, and returns a new string with the original string repeated count times, concatenated without spaces.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Math Power  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two integers: base number and power.  
- Implements a method that receives the base and power, and returns the base raised to the given power.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Greater of Two Values  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a type (string) and two values of that type from input.  
- The type can be "int", "char", or "string".  
- Implements methods to compare two values of the given type and returns the greater one.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
