- Read an integer number N and N integers from the console
- Find in percentages how many of these integers can divide without a remainder to numbers 2, 3 and 4
- Print the percentages, formatted to the second decimal digit:

  o On the first line print percent of the numbers that are divisible by 2  
  o On the first line print percent of the numbers that are divisible by 3  
  o On the first line print percent of the numbers that are divisible by 4

### 📝 Task 6: [Special Number]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to check if given number is special:

- Special numbers are divisible by all of their digits without remainder
- Reads an integer number and check whether it is a special number
- If the number IS special print: "{num} is special"
- If the number is NOT special print: "{num} is not special"

Note: There will not be numbers with digit 0 in them.

### 📝 Task 7: [Special Bonus]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to apply a 20% bonus for certain number:

- Reads an integer number from the console: the "stop number"
- Keep reading integers until it finds the stop number
- When the stop number is found, increase the value of the previous number before it with 20% and print it
