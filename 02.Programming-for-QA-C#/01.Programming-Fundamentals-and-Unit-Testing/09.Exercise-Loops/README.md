# Exercise - Loops – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Exercise - Loops** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Power of Number 
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer `n` from input.  
- Reads an integer `p` representing the power.  
- Calculates `n` raised to the power of `p` without using built-in power functions (use loops).  
- Prints the result.
Note: Don't use Math.Pow(), use loops

### 📝 Task 2: Multiplication Table  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer `n` from input.  
- Prints the multiplication table of size 10 for `n` in the format:  

  "{n} x {i} = {result}" for each i in the range [1…10]

---

### 📝 Task 3: Biggest Number  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer `n` – the count of numbers to read.  
- Reads `n` integers from input.  
- Finds and prints the biggest number among them.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Vowel Sum  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer `N` representing the number of characters.  
- Reads `N` characters.  
- Calculates the sum of the values of vowels from the given characters according to a predefined table.  
- Prints the total sum.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Division to 2, 3 and 4  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer `N`.  
- Reads `N` integers.  
- Calculates the percentage of numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 4 respectively.  
- Prints the percentages formatted to two decimal places, one per line in the order:  
1. Percentage divisible by 2  
2. Percentage divisible by 3  
3. Percentage divisible by 4

---

### 📝 Task 6: Special Number  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number.  
- Checks if the number is special, meaning it is divisible by each of its digits without a remainder.  
- Prints `"{num} is special"` if true, otherwise `"{num} is not special"`.  
> Note: Input numbers will not contain the digit zero.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Special Bonus  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads integers until a specific "stop number" is entered.  
- When the stop number is encountered, increases the value of the number read just before it by 20%.  
- Prints the updated value.

---

### 📝 Task 8: Account Balance  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a sequence of money transactions (incomes or expenses) until the command `"End"` is entered.  
- For each transaction, prints `"Increase: {amount}"` if positive or `"Decrease: {amount}"` if negative, formatted to two decimal places.  
- Calculates and prints the final balance formatted to two decimals in the format: `"Balance: {balance}"`.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
