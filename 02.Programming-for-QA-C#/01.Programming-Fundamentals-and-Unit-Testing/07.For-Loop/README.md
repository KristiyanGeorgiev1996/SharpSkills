- Reads `n` floating-point numbers  
- Calculates and prints their sum

### Task 4: Numbers Ending with 7 in a Range

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer `n` as the end of the range  
- Prints all numbers from 7 up to `n` that end with the digit 7

---

### Task 5: Numbers from 1 to N Greater Than or Equal to 3
