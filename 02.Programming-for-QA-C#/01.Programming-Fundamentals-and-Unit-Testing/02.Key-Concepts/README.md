# Key Concepts â€“ Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing ðŸ§‘ðŸ’»

This folder contains tasks from the **Key Concepts** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Currency Converter - USD to EUR

Develop a program that converts a given amount from US dollars to euros.  
- Input: a floating-point number representing the amount in USD.  
- Use a fixed exchange rate of 0.88 to convert the amount into EUR.  
- Output the result rounded to two decimal places.

### Task 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations

Write a program that receives two floating-point numbers and performs the following arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- Input: two floating-point numbers.  
- Output: print each operation with its result, formatted to two decimal places, as follows:  
  `{first number} + {second number} = {result}`  
  `{first number} - {second number} = {result}`  
  `{first number} * {second number} = {result}`  
  `{first number} / {second number} = {result}`

### Task 5: Deposit Profit Calculator

Implement a program that calculates the total amount after a deposit period using this formula:  
`total_amount = deposited_amount + term_months * (deposited_amount * annual_interest_rate / 12)`  
- Input:  
  1. Deposited amount (float) between 100.00 and 10000.00  
  2. Term duration in months (integer) between 1 and 12  
  3. Annual interest rate (float) between 0.00 and 100.00  
- Output: print the final amount after the term.

### Task 6: Reading Schedule Calculator

Help Joro figure out how many hours per day he needs to read to finish a book on time.  
- Input: three integers read from the console:  
  1. Total number of pages in the book (1 to 1000)  
  2. Number of pages read per hour (1 to 1000)  
  3. Number of days to finish the book (1 to 1000)  
- Note: Use integer division which truncates decimals.  
- Output: print the required reading hours per day.
