This folder contains tasks from the **Complex Conditional Statements** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## ðŸ”§ Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Product Price Lookup

- Reads three integers from the input  
- Finds and prints the largest number among them

---

### Task 3: Calculate Bonus Points

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer score  
- Adds bonus points depending on the score range:  
  - If score is between 0 and 3, add 5 points  
  - If score is between 4 and 6, add 15 points  
  - If score is between 7 and 9, add 20 points  
- Prints the total points after adding bonuses

- Prints `"drink"` if the product is one of: `"tea"`, `"water"`, `"coffee"`, or `"juice"`  
- Prints `"unknown"` if the product is not in the above lists

---

### Task 5: Validate Number Range

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number  
- Checks if the number is either 0 or within the inclusive range 100 to 200  
- Prints `"invalid"` if the number does not meet the criteria

---

### Task 6: Day Name by Number

Write a program that:

- Reads an integer between 1 and 7  
- Prints the corresponding weekday name:  
  - 1 â†’ `"Monday"`  
  - 2 â†’ `"Tuesday"`  
  - 3 â†’ `"Wednesday"`  
  - 4 â†’ `"Thursday"`  
  - 5 â†’ `"Friday"`  
  - 6 â†’ `"Saturday"`  
  - 7 â†’ `"Sunday"`  
- Prints `"Error"` if the number is outside this range

---

### Task 7: Identify Vowel or Consonant

Write a program that:

- Reads a single English alphabet letter (case-insensitive)  
- Prints `"Vowel"` if the letter is one of A, E, I, O, U  
- Prints `"Consonant"` otherwise

---

### Task 8: Check Sorting Order of Three Numbers

Write a program that:

- Reads three distinct integers  
- Prints `"Ascending"` if the numbers are in strictly increasing order  
- Prints `"Descending"` if the numbers are in strictly decreasing order  
- Prints `"Not sorted"` if neither condition is met

---

### Task 9: Cinema Ticket Cost Calculator

Write a program that:

- Reads the movie type (`"Premiere"`, `"Normal"`, or `"Discount"`), the number of rows, and seats per row  
- Calculates the total ticket price based on the movie type and seat count  
- Prints the total cost formatted to two decimal places  
- Refer to the original assignment for exact price details
