# Nested Loops – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Nested Loops** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Numbers From N to 1  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number N from input.  
- Prints the numbers from N down to 1, each on a separate line.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Even Powers of 2  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number n.  
- Prints the powers of two with even exponents in the range [0 … n], i.e.,  
  prints 2^0, 2^2, 2^4, … up to 2^n (only if exponent is even).

---

### 📝 Task 3: Triangle of Stars  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number (size of the triangle).  
- Prints a triangle of stars with the given size, line by line.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Building  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two integers: number of floors and number of estates per floor.  
- Prints a table representing the building with identifiers for each estate:  
  - Odd floors have apartments labeled `A{floor}{number}`  
  - Even floors have offices labeled `O{floor}{number}`  
  - The last floor has large apartments labeled `L{floor}{number}`

---

### 📝 Task 5: Number Pyramid  
Write a program that:  
- Reads an integer number n.  
- Prints a number pyramid of height n as shown in examples.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Travel Savings  
Write a program that:  
- Reads a destination (string) and needed budget (float).  
- Continuously reads collected money amounts until the budget is reached or exceeded.  
- After collecting enough money, prints:  
  - `"Collected: {sum}"` formatted to two decimals  
  - `"Going to {destination}!"`  
- Repeats the process for new destinations until the input destination is `"End"`.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Sum of Digits Calculator  
Write a program that:  
- Continuously reads integers from input until `"End"` is entered.  
- For each integer, prints the sum of its digits in the format:  
  `"Sum of digits = {sum}"`  
- After `"End"`, prints `"Goodbye"`.

---

### 📝 Task 8: Prime Numbers  
Write a program that:  
- Reads two integers: start and end of a range.  
- Prints all prime numbers within the given range inclusively.

> Hint: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
