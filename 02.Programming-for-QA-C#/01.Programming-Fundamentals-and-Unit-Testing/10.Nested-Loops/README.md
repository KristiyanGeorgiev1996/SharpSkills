This folder contains tasks from the **Nested Loops** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: [Numbers From N to 1]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number N from the console
- Prints the numbers from N to 1, each on separate line

---

### 📝 Task 2: [Even Powers of 2]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number n from the console
- Prints on the console the number two on even powers in the range [0; n]

  2 ≤ 2n: 20, 22, 24, 26, …, 2n.

### 📝 Task 3: [Triangle of Stars]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to print a triangle of stars like shown in the examples:

- Read the size (integer number) of a triangle from the console
- Print a triangle of stars

---

### 📝 Task 4: [Building]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to print a table, representing a building:

- Reads two integer numbers from the console: floors count and estates count per floor
- Identifiers consist of: {type}{floor}{number}, e.g. L65, A12, O24
- Odd floors hold apartments (type A), e.g. A10, A11, A12, …
- Even floors hold offices (type O), e.g. O20, O21, O22, …
- The last floor holds large apartments (type L), e.g. L60, L61, L62

### 📝 Task 5: [Number Pyramid]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number n from the console
- Prints a pyramid of numbers as shown in the examples

---

### 📝 Task 6: [Travel Savings]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that calculate the money collection for multiple travel destinations:

- Read a destination (string) and needed budget (floating-point number) for the destination
- Read many times amounts of collected money, until they are enough for the destination (starting from 0)

  o Print:

  "Collected: {sum}" where sum is formatted to 2nd digit

  or

  "Going to {destination}!"
  
- Read another destination and budget and collect money again
- A destination "End" ends the program

---

### 📝 Task 7: [Sum of Digits Calculator]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Continuously read integers until "End" is entered from the console

  o Print the sum of digits for each integer, use the following format:

  "Sum of digits = {sum}"

- Finally, print "Goodbye"

---

### 📝 Task 8: [Prime Numbers]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads two integer numbers: start of the range and end of the range
- Print all prime numbers in given range

Hint: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
