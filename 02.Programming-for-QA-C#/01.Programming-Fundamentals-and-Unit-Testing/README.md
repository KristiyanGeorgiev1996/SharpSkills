# Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing

The course covers fundamental programming concepts that serve as the foundation for effective and quality training in professional automated testing modules. Learners build on the knowledge acquired in the **QA Fundamentals (Manual)** module and begin studying basic programming techniques such as writing beginner-level code (basic coding skills), working with development environments (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using conditional statements (if, if-else), and loops (for, while, do-while), as well as component testing. The course also covers basic data structures in programming such as arrays and lists. It successfully builds an understanding among students regarding the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will gain from them, preparing them to become successful specialists in "automated software testing."
