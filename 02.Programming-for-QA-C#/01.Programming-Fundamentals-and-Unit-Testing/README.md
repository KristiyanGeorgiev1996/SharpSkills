# Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing

This course introduces the essential programming principles necessary for building a solid foundation in automated testing. It expands on the basics covered in the **QA Fundamentals (Manual)** module by teaching beginner-friendly coding skills, how to navigate development environments (IDEs), and how to work with variables, data types, operators, and expressions. Students will learn to handle console input/output, use conditional logic (if, if-else), and implement loops (for, while, do-while). The course also covers basic data structures such as arrays and lists and introduces component testing. It aims to prepare learners for the more advanced professional modules by equipping them with the skills needed to succeed in automated software testing roles.

## Skills you will develop

- Utilizing core features of the programming language  
- Manipulating linear data structures like arrays and lists  
- Creating and invoking methods  
- Writing and executing component (unit) tests  
- Grasping key concepts in automated testing
