# While Loop – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **While Loop** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Print Numbers from 1 to 100
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each on a new line.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Print Numbers from N Down to 1
Write a program that:
- Reads an integer `N` from input.
- Prints numbers from `N` down to 1, each on a new line.
> Note: `N` will always be greater than 1.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Read Odd Number
Write a program that:
- Continuously reads numbers from the input until an odd number is entered.
- Prints the odd number once it is entered.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Print Sequence 2k + 1
Write a program that:
- Starts the sequence at 1.
- Generates the next number as `previous_number * 2 + 1`.
- Reads an integer `n` from input.
- Prints all numbers in the sequence that are less than or equal to `n`.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Sum of Digits
Write a program that:
- Reads a positive integer from input.
- Calculates and prints the sum of its digits.
  
Example: For input `3451`, output should be `13` (3 + 4 + 5 + 1).

---

### 📝 Task 6: Read Number in Range [1 … 100]
Write a program that:
- Reads integer numbers until a number within the range [1 … 100] is entered.
- Prints the valid number and stops.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Number Processor
Write a program that:
- Reads an initial integer number.
- Processes a sequence of commands until the command `"End"` is received:
  - `"Inc"`: increment the number by 1.
  - `"Dec"`: decrement the number by 1.
- After `"End"` command, prints the final number.

**Note:** The tasks are adapted from the SoftUni course and have been reformulated to present clearer and more illustrative descriptions of each exercise.
