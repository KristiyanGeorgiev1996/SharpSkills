# While Loop – Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **While Loop** section of the _Programming Fundamentals and Unit Testing_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: [Numbers 1 to 100]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Print the numbers from 1 to 100, each on separate line

---

### 📝 Task 2: [Decreasing Numbers]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that:

- Reads an integer number N
- Print the numbers from N down to 1 (inclusively), each on separate line

Note: N will always be bigger than 1.

---

### 📝 Task 3: [Odd Number]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to enter an odd number:

- Read numbers from the console until an odd number is entered
- Print the odd number as output

---

### 📝 Task 4: [Sequence 2k + 1]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to print a sequence of numbers:

- The first number is 1
- Each next number is 2 times the previous number + 1
- Read an integer number n from the console – the max number
- Print the elements of the sequence (starting with 1), which are ≤ n

---

### 📝 Task 5: [Sum Digits]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to sum the digits of given number:

- Read an integer positive number from the console
- Sum its digits and print the sum

Example: The number is 3451. Digits sum is 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 13.

---

### 📝 Task 6: [Number In Range]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to read a number in the range [1 … 100]:

- Read an integer number from the console
- Check if the number is in the range [1 … 100]
  
  o No (number is NOT in the range) → read a new number  
  o Yes (number is IN the range) → print the number and the program stops

---

### 📝 Task 7: [Number Processor]  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program to process a sequence of commands:

- Read an initial number from the input
- Read and execute a sequence of the following commands:
  
  o "Inc" – add 1 to the number (increment)  
  o "Dec" – subtract 1 from the number (decrement)  
  o "End" – print the number and stop the program
