## üîß Tasks Overview:

### üìù Task 1: Randomize Words  
**Problem Statement:**  
You will be given a string that will contain words separated by a single space. Randomize their order and print each word on a new line.  

**Hints:**  
- Split the input string by space and create an array of words.  
- Create a random number generator ‚Äì an object `rnd` of type `Random`.  
- In a `for` loop exchange each word at positions `0, 1, ..., words.Length - 1` with a word at a random position.  
- To generate a random number in range use `rnd.Next(minValue, maxValue)`.  
  > Note: `minValue` is inclusive, `maxValue` is exclusive.  
- Print each word in the array on a new line.

### üìù Task 2: Big Factorial  
**Problem Statement:**  
You will receive a number `N` in the range `[0‚Ä¶1000]`. Calculate the factorial of `N` and print out the result.

### üìù Task 3: Songs  
**Problem Statement:**  
Define a class called `Song` that will hold the following information about some songs:  
- Type List  
- Name  
- Time  

**Input / Constraints:**  
- On the first line, you will receive the number of songs - `N`.  
- On the next `N` lines, you will be receiving data in the following format:  
{typeList}{name}{time}
- On the last line, you will receive either a specific `Type List` or the keyword `"all"`.  

**Output:**  
- If a `Type List` is given, print only the names of the songs from that list.  
- If the `"all"` command is received, print out the names of all the songs.

**Problem Statement:**  
Define a class called `Student`, which will hold the following information about some students:  
- First Name  
- Last Name  
- Age  
- Home Town  

**Input / Constraints:**  
- Read information about some students until you receive the `"end"` command.  
- After that, you will receive a city name.  

**Output:**  
- Print the students who are from the given city in the following format:  
{firstName} {lastName} is {age} years old.

### üìù Task 6: Store Boxes

- Serial Number  
- Item  
- Item Quantity  
- Price for a Box  

**Input:**  
- Until you receive `"end"`, you will be receiving data in the following format:  
{Serial Number} {Item Name} {Item Quantity} {itemPrice}

**Calculation:**  
- Price of a box = `itemQuantity * itemPrice`

**Output:**  
- Print all boxes ordered descending by price for a box in the following format:  
{boxSerialNumber}
-- {boxItemName} ‚Äì ${boxItemPrice}: {boxItemQuantity}
-- ${boxPrice}
  - The price should be formatted to 2 digits after the decimal separator.
