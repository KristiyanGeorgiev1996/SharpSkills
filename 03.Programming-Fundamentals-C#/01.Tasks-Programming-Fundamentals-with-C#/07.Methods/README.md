## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 📝 Task 1: Sign of Integer Numbers  
**Problem Statement:**  
A single integer is given. Create a method that checks if the given number is positive, negative, or zero. As a result, print:

- For a positive number: `"The number {number} is positive."`  
- For a negative number: `"The number {number} is negative."`  
- For zero: `"The number {number} is zero."`

### 📝 Task 2: Grades  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a method that receives a grade between 2.00 and 6.00 and prints the corresponding grade definition:

- 2.00 – 2.99 → `"Fail"`  
- 3.00 – 3.49 → `"Poor"`  
- 3.50 – 4.49 → `"Good"`  
- 4.50 – 5.49 → `"Very good"`  
- 5.50 – 6.00 → `"Excellent"`

---

### 📝 Task 3: Calculations  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a program that receives three lines of input:

1. A string – `"add"`, `"multiply"`, `"subtract"`, or `"divide"`  
2. A number  
3. Another number  

You should create four methods (for each calculation) and invoke the corresponding method depending on the command. The method should also print the result (should be `void`).

---

### 📝 Task 4: Printing Triangle  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a method for printing triangles.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Orders  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a program that calculates and prints the total price of an order. The method should receive two parameters:

- A string, representing a product: `"coffee"`, `"water"`, `"coke"`, `"snacks"`  
- An integer, representing the quantity of the product  

The prices for a single item of each product are:

- Coffee – 1.50  
- Water – 1.00  
- Coke – 1.40  
- Snacks – 2.00  

Print the result, rounded to the second decimal place.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Calculate Rectangle Area  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a method that calculates and returns the area of a rectangle.

---

### 📝 Task 7: Repeat String  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a method that receives two parameters:

- A string  
- An integer `n` representing how many times the string will be repeated  

The method should return a new string containing the initial one, repeated `n` times (without spaces).

---

### 📝 Task 8: Math Power  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a method that receives two numbers as parameters:

- The first number – the base  
- The second number – the power  

The method should return the base raised to the given power.

---

### 📝 Task 9: Greater of Two Values  
**Problem Statement:**  
You are given input of two values of the same type. The values can be of type `int`, `char`, or `string`. Create methods called `GetMax()` which can compare `int`, `char`, or `string` values and return the biggest of the two.

---

### 📝 Task 10: Multiply Evens by Odds  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a program that multiplies the sum of all even digits of a number by the sum of all odd digits of the same number. You should:

- Create a method `GetMultipleOfEvenAndOdds()`  
- Create a method `GetSumOfEvenDigits()`  
- Create a method `GetSumOfOddDigits()`  

*Note:* You may need to use `Math.Abs()` for negative numbers.

---

### 📝 Task 11: Math Operations  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a method that receives two numbers and an operator, calculates the result, and returns it. You will be given three lines of input:

1. First number  
2. Operator  
3. Second number  

The possible operators are: `/`, `*`, `+`, and `-`.
