## 📁 Project Overview

### 🪨✂️📄 Rock Paper Scissors – Additional Project  
A classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user competes against the computer. The implementation uses basic control structures such as `if-else`, `switch`, loops, and string/character handling.

**Key Concepts:**
- Using the `Random` class
- Handling user input
- Implementing game logic and winner determination

---

### 🔢 Guess a Number – Additional Project  
A number-guessing game where the computer selects a random number, and the user attempts to guess it with the help of hints. The program includes input/output operations and loop control.

**Key Concepts:**
- Generating random numbers
- Conditional logic
- Handling invalid user input

---

### 📝 Random Sentences Generator – Additional Project  
A random sentence generator that creates humorous phrases by combining words from predefined arrays.

**Key Concepts:**
- Working with arrays (`string[]`)
- Using the `Random` class
- Structuring logic within the `Main()` method and extracting reusable methods
