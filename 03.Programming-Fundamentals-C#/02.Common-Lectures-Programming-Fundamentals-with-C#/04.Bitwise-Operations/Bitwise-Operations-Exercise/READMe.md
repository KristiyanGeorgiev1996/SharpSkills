# Bits & Bitwise Operations – Programming Fundamentals with C# 🧑💻

This folder contains tasks from the **Bits & Bitwise Operations** section of the _Programming Fundamentals with C#_ course at SoftUni. Below are the tasks with brief descriptions.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview:

### 📝 Task 1: Count Binary Digits  
**Problem Statement:**  
Given a positive integer and a binary digit (0 or 1), determine how many times that digit appears in the binary form of the number.

---

### 📝 Task 2: Inspect Bit at Position 1  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that prints the value of the bit at position 1 (second bit from the right) of a given integer.

---

### 📝 Task 3: Inspect Bit at Arbitrary Position  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that prints the bit at a given position `p` of an integer. Positions are counted from right to left, starting from 0.

---

### 📝 Task 4: Clear Bit at Position  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a program that sets the bit at a specified position `p` of a given integer to 0, and prints the resulting integer.

---

### 📝 Task 5: Find Odd Occurring Number  
**Problem Statement:**  
Given an array of positive integers where every number occurs an even number of times except one, identify the number that occurs an odd number of times using only bitwise operations.

---

### 📝 Task 6: Tri-Bit Toggle  
**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that inverts three consecutive bits starting from a given position `p` in a 32-bit integer using XOR operations. Print the resulting integer.
