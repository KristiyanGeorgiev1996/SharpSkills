## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 📐 Math & Logic
- Coordinate systems  
- Vectors and matrices  
- FSM (Finite State Machines)  
- Algorithm complexity

### 🧊 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Modeling with classes and objects  
- Core principles:  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Abstraction  
  - Polymorphism

### ⚙️ FP (Functional Programming)
- Pure functions without side effects  
- Declarative style  
- Lambda functions and higher-order functions

### 🧮 Data Structures & Algorithms
- Arrays, lists, stacks, queues  
- Trees  
- Traversal: DFS / BFS

### 🧩 Modular & Event-Driven Approach
- Components  
- Event-driven reactions (GUIs, games, interactive systems)

### 🏗️ Software Architecture Models
- Monolithic applications  
- Client–Server  
- Front-End and Back-End communication via HTTP APIs  
- 3-tier architecture and microservices

### 🌐 Full-Stack Development
- Combining front-end and back-end skills  
- Managing databases (SQL / NoSQL)  
- Integrating all application layers
