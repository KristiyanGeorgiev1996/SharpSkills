# üß™ HTTP Practice Exercise ‚Äì Basic Requests with Postman

This exercise guides you through making basic HTTP requests using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). You'll learn how to work with GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH methods by interacting with a Firebase-based API.

## üìå API Base URL

All requests go to the Firebase endpoint:

https://trips-48955.firebaseio.com/trips.json


---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get All Trips

Make a **GET** request to list all available trips:

GET https://trips-48955.firebaseio.com/trips.json

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Trip

Make a **POST** request to add a new trip.

**Request URL**:
POST https://trips-48955.firebaseio.com/trips.json


**Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "description": "October-November and February-March are the best times to see the northern lights. Dark skies yield better displays ‚Äì avoid full moon.",
  "imagePath": "https://www.aurora-nights.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/norway-northern-lights-1500x587_c.jpg",
  "name": "Capture the Northern Lights on camera"
}
```
üü¢ **Expected Result**: A unique postId is returned by Firebase in the response body.

Use the postId returned from the previous step to delete the newly created trip.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Edit an Existing Trip
Now perform a **PATCH** request to update an existing trip.

Request URL:
PATCH https://trips-48955.firebaseio.com/trips/-MIJ0HydEYF0x6fljO55.json

Request Body (JSON):
```
{
  "description": "Egypt welcomes you!",
  "imagePath": "https://www.karacitours.bg/public/thumbs/767x341/egipet/egipet-4_767x341_crop_542eb8694d.jpg",
  "name": "Pyramids of Giza, Egypt",
  "edit": "true"
