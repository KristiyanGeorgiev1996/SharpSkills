# Common Lectures - Programming Fundamentals with C#

This file contains all the **common lectures** covered in the **Programming Fundamentals with C#** course. The lectures cover key concepts and technologies that are fundamental to a deeper understanding of programming and software development.

## Technologies and Topics Covered:

Throughout the course, the following important topics and concepts were explored:

- **HTTP Basics**  
  The basic structure of the HTTP protocol was studied, including requests and responses, HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, as well as the structure of HTTP headers. This topic is essential for understanding the communication between client and server in web development.

- **Software Development Concepts - Part 1**  
  This lecture covered the fundamentals of software engineering, including development processes, basic software architecture principles, and the software product lifecycle. This part helped build a solid foundation for working in software development teams.

- **Software Development Concepts - Part 2**  
  This lecture expands on the understanding of software engineering, focusing on specific aspects of software development such as team practices, roles within teams, and the use of approaches like Agile and Scrum. Important tools and technologies for project management were also discussed.

- **Bitwise Operations**  
  Opportunities for manipulating data at the bit level were explored in this lecture. This topic shows how to use bitwise operations for code optimization and working with data at a lower level.

- **Problem Solving**  
  This lecture covered basic approaches to problem-solving in programming, including breaking down tasks into smaller steps, avoiding complex algorithms, and applying best practices for organizing solutions.

- **Database Basics**  
  The fundamentals of databases were covered, with a focus on relational databases and basic operations such as creating tables, retrieving data, and manipulating information using SQL queries.

- **QA Introduction**  
  Basic principles of software quality assurance (QA) were introduced, including testing methodologies, automated testing, and the importance of properly testing software products to ensure their reliability.

## Important Note about HTML & CSS:

The **HTML & CSS** topic has been moved to a separate repository due to its importance and significant role in modern web development. In addition to being essential for creating web pages, it will also be covered in advanced courses. For better clarity and easier learning of the materials, it was decided to separate it into its own repository.
