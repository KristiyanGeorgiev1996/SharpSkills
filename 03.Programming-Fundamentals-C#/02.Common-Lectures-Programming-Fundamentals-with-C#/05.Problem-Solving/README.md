# 🧩 Problem Solving & Algorithm Design 

This lecture explains how software engineers approach problems and develop algorithms efficiently.

## 💻 Key Skills

- Coding (20%), algorithmic thinking (30%), software concepts (25%), technologies & languages (25%)  
- **Algorithmic thinking:** breaking complex problems into clear, step-by-step solutions

## 🎯 Problem-Solving Process

1. Define the problem clearly  
2. Analyze inputs, outputs, and constraints  
3. Generate possible solutions  
4. Evaluate and select the best approach  
5. Design the algorithm  
6. Implement in code  
7. Review and test thoroughly

## ✅ Exam Tips

- Read all problems first and prioritize easier ones  
- Use paper for visualization  
- Manage time effectively and avoid over-focusing on one problem  
- Avoid common pitfalls: coding without understanding, skipping planning, inefficient input handling, skipping breaks

## 🔧 Example: Longest Palindrome Sub-List

- Identify the longest contiguous sequence in a list that reads the same forwards and backwards  
- **Efficient method:** expand around single or double centers  
- Test edge cases like single letters, repeated letters, and even/odd-length palindromes

**Summary:** Structured problem-solving and algorithmic thinking are essential for software development and success in programming exams.
