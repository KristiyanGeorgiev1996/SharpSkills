# 🗄️ Database Basics

This lecture covers the essentials of databases and how developers use SQL and NoSQL systems to manage data.

## 💡 Key Points
- Databases store and organize data for easy access, management, and updates.
- DBMS (Database Management Systems) define structure, handle CRUD operations, and ensure performance, security, and consistency.

## 🧩 Types of Databases
- **Relational (SQL):** Structured tables, fixed schema, uses SQL. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
- **NoSQL:** Flexible data models (documents, key-value, graphs), scalable for large/unstructured data. Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.

## ⚙️ SQL Basics
- Tables with rows and columns
- Commands: 
  - DDL (structure)  
  - DML (data)  
  - DCL (access)  
  - TCL (transactions)
- Common operations: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE/DROP tables/databases`

## 📄 NoSQL / MongoDB Basics
- Stores JSON-like documents
- Flexible schema, scalable, high performance
- Common operations: create collections, insert/find/update/delete documents

## ✅ Summary
Understanding databases and how to interact with them using SQL or NoSQL is key for efficient software development and handling structured or unstructured data.
